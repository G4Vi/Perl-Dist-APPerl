Revision history for Perl-Dist-APPerl
v0.6.0  2024-05-27
        Add building with modern Cosmopolitan Libc with cosmocc 3.3.10
          cosmocc automatically installs itself making running
          `apperlm install-build-deps` unnecessary
        Add download and building from Perl tarballs.
          Add patch loading system so Perl changes can be maintained from
          this repo. Can locate "share" dir even when used from APPerl.
        Fix install_modules not linking all extensions.
          Devel::PPort and DynaLoader weren't being linked in
          This caused Cwd.pm to fail to load its XS
        Improve apperlm list
        Include ErrnoRuntime in small builds
        Deprecate vista builds
          Without cosmocc being avaiable on the port, they have to be
          maintained essentially seperately.
        Remove most of the versioned configs, they were far behind the
          rolling release / unnamed builds and often changed with them.
        Make $^X more reliable by using Cosmos's GetProgramExecutableName
        Set $Config{perlpath} to $^X (GH#6)
        Fix APPERL_DEFAULT_SCRIPT search by including nul in string.

        on disk via "install_modules" in project config.
